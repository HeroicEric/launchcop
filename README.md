# LaunchCop

LaunchCop is built on top of [RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop). When
you run `launchcop`, it actually just runs RuboCop, but with our configuration.

## Installation

`gem install launchcop`

## Usage

Run `launchcop` exactly the same as you would run Rubocop. The only difference
is that it's going to use our default configuration.

## Contributing

1. Fork it ( https://github.com/LaunchAcademy/LaunchCop/fork )
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request

## Props

Props to [thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com/) and their style guide. The `rubocop.yml` file in this
repository was actually copied from their
[Hound](https://github.com/thoughtbot/hound) project.
